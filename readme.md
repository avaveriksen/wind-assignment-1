## Program structure
> The program runs from `main.py`, and calls functions from `windtools.py`
* **main.py**: Holds the main loop for the program.
* **windtools.py**: Hold the helper functions.

## Issues / Tasks

### Program

```python
'''use BEM to determine this best
operational parameters for the DTU 10MW WT and the
corresponding maximum Cp'''

for lambda in range(5, 10)
    for Theta_p in range(-3, 4)
        for element in elements
            # BEM that shit
        end

        # compute power and thrust from load distributions
        # calculate C_p(lambda, Theta_p)
    end
end

# Determine C_p_max(lambda_max, Theta_p_max)
                

```
