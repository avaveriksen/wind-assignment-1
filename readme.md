# Wind Assignment 1

How to write MD files: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

## File structure
One file for computation, another file for tools (functions).

## Issues / Tasks

```python
'''use BEM to determine this best
operational parameters for the DTU 10MW WT and the
corresponding maximum Cp'''

for lambda in range(5, 10)
    for Theta_p in range(-3, 4)
        for element in elements
            # BEM that shit
        end

        # compute power and thrust from load distributions
        # calculate C_p(lambda, Theta_p)
    end
end

# Determine C_p_max(lambda_max, Theta_p_max)
                

```
